METAL Composer is an advanced animation trainer for SM64 for use with M64MM. The current version supports M64MM3 **Alpha 2 and above** only. If you're not using Alpha 2 and above, you are strongly encouraged to **UPDATE M64MM**.

## Features
* Pause, rewind and set different loop points for Mario's animations
* Set the speed of Mario's animation
* Do spazzing (cartridge tilting) on Mario's animation only without longlasting repercussions on the current game session
* Load external animations exported with CometFAST64 (METAL Composer+) and string many of these together (Chainer)
* Look (relatively) awesome ðŸ”²


## Contributing
You have to ask me! I don't have a contribution guide just yet.

## Roadmap
* Not much! I've incorporated many things I wanted to incorporate, and I'm quite happy, but I'm always open to discussion!
